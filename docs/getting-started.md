# Getting Started

To get acquainted with Ergogen quickly, your best bet is following these steps in order:

1. Check out my introductory talk on core concepts and background to get a quick overview of what's waiting for you here.

    </div>

1. Read the [docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz). D'uuh. It's still in progress, and might be a bit dense and dry, but it does walk you through the full functionality and contains plenty of examples.

1. Try one of the web-based deployments ([official](https://ergogen.xyz); [unofficial](https://ergogen.ceoloide.com/) but probably better and soon to be official) - no need to download the CLI unless you want to A) preview in-development features, B) use custom modifications, or C) contribute code. Click things, look at outputs; see if things start to make sense.

1. Search the [`#ergogen`](https://github.com/topics/ergogen) topic on GitHub to look at (and reverse engineer) a variety of real life configs using ergogen. Pop them into the web UI, see what they do, tinker with them; things should start to make more and more sense.

1. If a question persists after all of the above, feel free to ask it over on [Discord](http://discord.ergogen.xyz) and we'll do our best to help you out.
