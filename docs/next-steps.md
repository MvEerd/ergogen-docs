# Next steps

*Theoretically*, you should know everything to start making your own dream keyboard.  
*Realistically* though, this might have been a bit dense, to say the least. But hey, this is the full reference, what did you expect?  

If you want to look at further examples, take a peek at the [`#ergogen`](https://github.com/topics/ergogen) topic on GitHub.
There are also super cool 3rd party tutorials and content on Ergogen, if you're interested in reading/watching further:

- [Let's Design A Keyboard With Ergogen v4](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-introduction/) - tutorial series by FlatFootFox
- [The REAL Ergonomic Keyboard Endgame!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKfeJrRIcxw) - a video touching on an older Ergogen version by Ben Vallack

Alternatively, if you'd like to talk to a "certified Ergogen representative", come join us [on Discord](http://discord.ergogen.xyz)!
It's also a great place to get in touch if you are already somewhat familiar with this whole shebang, and would like to contribute examples, tests, features, whatever.
See you there!
