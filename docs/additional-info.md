# Additional info

*Theoretically*, you should know everything to start making your own dream keyboard.  
*Realistically* though, this might have been a bit dense, to say the least.  But hey, this is the full reference, what did you expect?  

If you want to look at an example that leverages the full power of Ergogen, you can find [the Absolem project](https://github.com/mrzealot/absolem/) and its [configuration file here.](https://github.com/mrzealot/absolem/blob/master/absolem.yaml)

If you'd like to get your feet wet with easier examples, and get gradually more hard-core, let me suggest the other tutorials in the docs folder (as they become available).
Alternatively, if you'd like to talk to a certified Ergogen representative, come join us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/nbKcAZB)!
It's also a great place to get in touch if you are already somewhat familiar with this whole shebang, and would like to contribute examples, tests, features, whatever.
See you there!
